Hello! As an AI assistant, I'd be happy to explain the workflows in this project and how this change fits in.

### Workflows in this Project

This project has four main GitHub Actions workflows, all designed to leverage Gemini for automating various development tasks:

1.  **`üí¨ Gemini CLI` (`gemini-cli.yml`):** This is a general-purpose workflow that allows authorized users to interact with the Gemini CLI directly within GitHub. By mentioning `@gemini-cli` in an issue or pull request comment, you can ask Gemini to perform tasks like explaining code, making changes, or answering questions.

2.  **`üè∑Ô∏è Gemini Automated Issue Triage` (`gemini-issue-automated-triage.yml`):** This workflow helps automatically triage incoming GitHub issues. When a new issue is created, it uses Gemini to analyze the title and body to apply appropriate labels (e.g., `kind/bug`, `area/docs`, `priority/high`). This helps in organizing and prioritizing work.

3.  **`‚è∞ Gemini Scheduled Issue Triage` (`gemini-issue-scheduled-triage.yml`):** This workflow runs on a schedule (hourly) to find any open issues that haven't been triaged yet. It uses Gemini to label them, ensuring that no issue is missed.

4.  **`ü§ñ Gemini Pull Request Review` (`gemini-pr-review.yml`):** This workflow provides automated code reviews on pull requests. When a PR is opened, or when triggered manually, it uses Gemini to analyze the code changes and provide feedback on aspects like security, performance, reliability, and maintainability.

### How This Change Fits In

The change in this pull request is a small but helpful cosmetic improvement. It adds a "üí¨" emoji to the display name of the **Gemini CLI** workflow.

This change fits in by:

*   **Improving Readability:** The emoji makes the workflow more visually distinct in the GitHub Actions UI, making it slightly easier and faster to identify among other workflows.
*   **Enhancing User Experience:** It adds a bit of personality and visual polish to the project, which contributes to a better developer experience.

This change does not alter the logic or functionality of any workflow; it's purely a UI enhancement.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
